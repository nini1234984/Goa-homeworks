<h1>HTML</h1>
<p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language[a] for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. 
    It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) 
    and scripting languages such as JavaScript, a programming language.</p>

<h2>HISTORY</h2>
<h3>Development</h3>
<p>In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents.
    In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.
    [4] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. 
    That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding,
    but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990,
     Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.</p>

<p>The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags",
    [6] first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.[7][8] It describes 18 elements comprising the initial,
    relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by CERN SGML,
    an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.[9]</p>

<h2>HTML version timeline</h2>
<h3>HTML 2</h3>
<h3>November 24, 1995</h3>
<p>HTML 2.0 was published as RFC 1866. Supplemental RFCs added capabilities:</p>

<h3>HTML 3</h3>
<h3>January 14, 1997</h3>
<p>HTML 3.2[16] was published as a W3C Recommendation. 
  It was the first version developed and standardized exclusively by the W3C, as the IETF had closed its HTML 
  Working Group on September 12, 1996.</p>

<h2>Tim Berners-Lee</h2>
<p>Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee (born 8 June 1955),[1] also known as TimBL,
   is an English computer scientist best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web, the HTML markup language, 
   the URL system, and HTTP. He is a professorial research fellow at the University of Oxford[2] and a professor emeritus at
    the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).[3][4]</p>
